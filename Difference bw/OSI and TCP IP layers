OSI model :
APPLICATION LAYER
PRESENTATION LAYER 
SESSION LAYER
TRANSPORT LAYER
NETWORK LAYER
DATA LINK LAYER
PHYSICAL LAYER

TCP/IP model :
APPLICATION LAYER (covers A.P.S of OSI)
TRANSPORT LAYER 
INTERNET LAYER (covers network layer of OSI)
NETWORK ACCESS LAYER  (covers D.P)

1. OSI has 7 layers whereas TCP/IP has 4 layers.
2. The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems open to interconnection and
communication with other systems. On the other hand, TCP/IP helps you to determine how a specific computer should be connected 
to the internet and how you can be transmitted between them.
3. OSI header is 5 bytes whereas TCP/IP header size is 20 bytes.
4. OSI refers to Open Systems Interconnection whereas TCP/IP refers to Transmission Control Protocol.
5. OSI follows a vertical approach whereas TCP/IP follows a horizontal approach.
6. OSI model, the transport layer, is only connection-oriented whereas the TCP/IP model is both connection-oriented and 
connectionless.
7. OSI model is developed by ISO (International Standard Organization), whereas TCP Model is developed by ARPANET
  (Advanced Research Project Agency Network).
8. OSI model helps you to standardize router, switch, motherboard, and other hardware whereas TCP/IP helps you to establish
   a connection between different types of computers.
