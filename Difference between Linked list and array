So when we talk about the difference between the linked list and array
the biggest difference between them is that array follows static memory allocation
and linked list on other hand follows dynamically memory allocation,

In array there will always be a limited or fixed size
but in linked list there is no fixed size.

Insertion/Deletion is easy in LL but on other hand. it takes a lot of efforts in array

 Linked list provides following two advantages over arrays
1) Dynamic size
2) Ease of insertion/deletion

Linked lists have following drawbacks
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cant do
binary search with linked lists.
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
3) Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.
